Hello world!

This is my repository for learning Python using the Learn to Program: The Fundamentals with the University of Toronto. 
https://www.coursera.org/learn/learn-to-program

There will be two directories; one for my submitted assignments and any further edits I make; another for any testing in between assignment weeks.

I hope you enjoy :)
